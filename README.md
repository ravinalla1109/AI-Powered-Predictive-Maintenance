# AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview
This project builds a predictive maintenance system using machine learning to forecast equipment failures. By analyzing historical data, it aims to reduce downtime and optimize operational efficiency.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model deployment as an API
- Visualizations of insights and predictions

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets
- `models/`: Stores trained models
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and experimentation
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and model training
- `visualizations/`: Charts and plots for insights

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance

---

### Populate Directories
- `data/`: Add placeholder files like `raw_data.csv` and `processed_data.csv`.
- `scripts/`:
  - Create `data_preprocessing.py` for cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Create `train_model.py` for training machine learning models.
  - Create `deploy_model.py` for deploying the model using Flask.
- `visualizations/`: Add placeholder files for generated plots.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Populate each script (`data_preprocessing.py`, `train_model.py`, etc.) with detailed Python code.
2. Let me know which script youâ€™d like help with next!
