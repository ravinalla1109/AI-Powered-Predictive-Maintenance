# AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview
This project implements a predictive maintenance system leveraging machine learning to forecast potential equipment failures before they occur. By analyzing historical data, the system enables proactive measures to reduce downtime, optimize resource allocation, and enhance operational efficiency. The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model deployment and visualization.

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering for robust model input.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) using historical data.
- **Deployment**: API-based model deployment using Flask for real-time predictions.
- **Visual Insights**: Detailed visualizations for trends, feature importance, and prediction accuracy.
- **Extensibility**: Scalable design allowing easy integration with big data tools and cloud platforms.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Populate the `data/` Directory
Add the necessary datasets:
- `raw_data.csv`: Raw input data containing historical maintenance logs.
- `processed_data.csv`: (Optional) If preprocessing is already complete.

---

## Usage

### 1. Preprocess the Data
Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:
```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
```

### 2. Train the Model
Train the predictive maintenance model and save it to the `models/` directory:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### 3. Deploy the Model
Start the Flask server to make predictions via API:
```bash
python scripts/deploy_model.py
```

### 4. Test the API
Use `curl` or Postman to interact with the API:
- Check model status:
  ```bash
  curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/status
  ```
- Make predictions:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8]}'
  ```

## Visualizations
Explore visualizations stored in the `visualizations/` directory, including:
- **Feature Importance**: Key factors influencing predictions.
- **Trends and Insights**: Historical data trends and model predictions.

---

## Roadmap
- **Big Data Integration**: Process large-scale datasets using Hadoop/Spark.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the system on AWS/GCP for scalability.
- **Advanced Models**: Incorporate deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- **Dashboard**: Create a dynamic dashboard for real-time monitoring and insights.
